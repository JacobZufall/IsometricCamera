# IsometricCamera
A simple isometric camera for Roblox.

To use this script, create a LocalScript inside of game.Players.StarterPlayerScripts and paste the code from script.lua inside.
This script runs completely on the client.

It is also recommended to make CameraMinZoomDistance equal to CameraMaxZoomDistance.
Not doing so can cause the mouse to lock to the center of the screen if the player zooms in, which can be annoying.

Please note, you are free to use this in your game and make changes to it as you please. But, in accordance with the GNU GPLv3 license, all changes must be open sourced.
